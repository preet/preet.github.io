###About Me

Hi! My name is Preet Desai. I have a keen interest in working with computers and robotics in medical, automotive and GIS applications. I'm especially motivated by opportunities to work on projects that can markedly improve quality of life through technology.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Waterloo and work experience in medical imaging and robotics research. For the last two years, I've been developing software for interacting with vehicle telemetry/on-board diagnostics and visualizing map data in 3d. See the Projects page for more information.
